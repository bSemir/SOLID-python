# SOLID principles in practice, using Python.
# 
This is a 7th part of two-week online training program for paid internship at ***Tech387***.
#
The base idea was to show SOLID principles in action on a program for orders and payments.
#
While I was following this tutorial, I wrote some comments about each principle, their problem and their solution, which you can see in the code section.
#
But, before everything, I suggest you to go watch this video by Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHiWqnTWsn4&ab_channel=FucktheCommunism and then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB30aXS77U&ab_channel=ArjanCodes
